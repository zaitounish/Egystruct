# ConstructionCompanyWebsite
Me [@YousefOnWeb](https://github.com/yousefonweb) and my lovely friend from university [@zaitounish](https://github.com/zaitounish) made this website project as an assignment for our Web Technologies Associate Professor.<br>
We have decided to make the website for a construction company out of the choices was provided to us.<br>We
assumed the company is called Egystruct, and it offers construction services, and itâ€™s expanding its
reachability through the website.<br>
### Notes
* Some media in the website was intentionally downsized to an unfavoured, and illogical resolution (scale) before hosting it to only Github to fit Github's free account storage limitations. And the main form of the project looks completely fine (except for the hosted review on Github), So don't worry at all about why some media in the site (in the link below) will look very blurred or downsized.
* The site's interface is not yet phone-friendly.
